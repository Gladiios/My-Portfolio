      Hi, i'm Erwan, a Front-End Developer. <br /> <br /> Since childhood, i
      spend most of my time in front of a screen, i also like to learn, create
      and design. <br />
      <br />
      I've worked as an apprentice pastry chef from 2016 to 2018 at the
      Boulangerie Cherie in Potigny and earned a diploma in this field, but i
      immediately stopped since i weren't passionate enough to keep working in
      this area.
      <br />
      <br />
      After that, in 2019 i worked for something like 2 months as garbage
      collector, then i worked for 2 years as a order picker at Metaluplast, a
      factory creating sports equipment.
      <br />
      <br />
      As the pay was not good enough for me, i stopped working at Metaluplast
      and found a job as a delivery guy in june 2021 for DPD and Chronopost, i
      became a manager shortly after being recruited and I managed a team of 5
      people. Near the end of 2022 i made arrangements with my employer to quit
      since i was tired of doing this job and in january 2023 my contract came
      to a end.
      <br />
      Currently i'm only able to do front-end development,but i intend to learn
      back-end development in a near future.
